drone delivery system

Order time take 1 seconds = 1 km to deliver to Client

After the drone arrives at the cleint, the drone longitude and latitude is set to the cleint longitude and latitude

I have added the database in the SQL Database file

If first order is place there will be 10 clients generated, that I use from the DATA folder
